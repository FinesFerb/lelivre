This is my graduation thesis from college. I wrote it using the laravel framework, mysql and sqlite databases. I also integrated the pdf reader component into my project. I have implemented the ability to log in via social media and send a password by email. The site is adaptive. This site is an online library with a built-in reader and a personal account. I called it that because it means "book" in French. And I love French literature.
